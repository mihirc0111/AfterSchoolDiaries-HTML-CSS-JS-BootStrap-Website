### Difficultes Faced----------->-Solutions are welcomed on my gmail (mihirc0111@gmail.com)/on github. 

1. Unable to add keydown function to the button"Stop"

2. Unable to add 6 images in the carousel of bootstrap

3.Unable to align the divs inside container to centre properly,did a hack like adding margin

4.Unable to make a function which stops the already playing video and starts the next video which is clicked,so i had to make a stop button for it.

5.If stop button is not clicked, multiples sound play simultaneously

6. Unable to make width of images 100%..some gap is left between division(div) and image.

### Continued development

I would like to learn futher advanced JS and Jquery to make website's design more attractive and make the functioning of it more smooth and user friendly.
